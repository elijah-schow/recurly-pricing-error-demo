# Recurly Demo Project

### Setup

To get started, make a copy of `.env.example`, rename it to `.env`, and enter your Recurly public key.

### Running

```
npm start
```

### Debugging

The important code is in `/src/App.tsx`.

Pay attention to the console for debug messages. If you don't see them, make
sure your dev console is set to show ALL log levels.
